# Helioviewer API Documentation
If you're looking for the published API Docs, they can be found at
https://api.helioviewer.org/docs/v2/

## Updating Docs
The documents written here use [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
which is very similar to markdown. Click the link for a reference to how to
write it.

## Building Docs
First make sure you have the right python dependences by running
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The documentation is generated with sphinx with the following command:
```bash
make docs
```

Note this only works on Linux/Mac. The windows make.bat hasn't been updated with
this shortcut. To make docs on windows you must run `make html` and then copy
the results to ..\\..\\docroot\\docs\\v2. (Please someone implement this in a PR)

# History
This API Documentation used to be generated by manually writing some XML
in a messy file called `api_definitions.xml`. This was then run through some
dubious PHP code that scanned the XML and generated the documentation. This
worked quite well for a long time, but Daniel didn't enjoy writing XML that
under a strict schema and he did not want to subject that pain to anybody else.
And so, the documentation generation was migrated to sphinx.
