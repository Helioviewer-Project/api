Screenshots
-----------

The screenshot APIs can be used to generate custom videos of up to three image
datasource layers composited together. Solar feature/event markers pins,
extended region polygons, associated text labels, and a size-of-earth scale
indicator can optionally be overlayed onto a movie.
